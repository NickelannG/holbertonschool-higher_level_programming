# Project Name 
Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

## Learning Objectives:
1. <u>Abstract Classes:</u> Understand and apply abstract classes to define common interfaces while enforcing certain levels of class completeness.
2. <u>Interfaces and Duck Typing:</u> Grasp the concept of interfaces and duck typing to ensure that objects adhere to a specific contract or protocol.
3. <u>Subclassing Standard Base Classes:</u> Learn to extend standard base classes like lists, dictionaries, and iterators to create custom data structures with specialized behavior.
4. <u>Method Overriding:</u> Employ method overriding to alter or enhance the behavior of base class methods.
5. <u>Multiple Inheritance:</u> Understand and apply multiple inheritance to form complex relationships between classes.
6. <u>Mixins:</u> Utilize mixins to compose behavior across unrelated classes.
